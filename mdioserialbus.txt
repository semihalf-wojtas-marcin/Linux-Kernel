Subject: [RFC] ACPI Code First ECR: MDIOSerialBus resource descriptor macro

Management Data Input/Output (MDIO), also known as Serial Management
Interface (SMI) is a serial bus defined for the Ethernet family of
IEEE 802.3 standards for the Media Independent Interface (MII).
The MDIO bus is mostly used for controlling Ethernet PHYs, but
it can also communicate with other type of devices, such as switches.



On some systems there are devices that should better be left in their
current power state before attempting to bind drivers to them in order
to avoid some undesirable side effects of turning the power on (e.g.
blinking a privacy LED of a camera that may confuse the user to
believe that the camera sensor is in use while in fact the camera is
only being probed by a driver).

To support this use case, define a new device PM object called _DSC
(Deepest State for Configuration) returning the deepest D-state the
device can be in before evaluating its _CRS, _PRS and _SRS configuration
objects.

# Summary of the Change
Introduce a new device PM object called _DSC (Deepest State for Configuration)
returning the deepest D-state the device can be in before evaluating its _CRS,
_PRS and _SRS configuration objects.

# Benefits of the Change
It will allow OSPMs to avoid putting devices into D0 in order to check and set
their resources if _DSC is present and its return value is greater than 0.  In
particular, if _DSC returns 4 (assuming that _PR3 is present for the given
device), the device can remain in D3cold during driver probe and the driver
should be able to gather all of the information needed by it to operate the
device without changing its power state.

# Impact of the Change
Enable certain device power management optimizations.
